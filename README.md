# My Favorite Environment

This repo is my personal repo to get all of my setup scripts in one location. So if I ever have to bootstrap a new computer I can just clone this repo and run a few scripts in sequence and be done.

As I find a need for more contained environments I intend to add vagrant boxes for specific use cases.
